Clean-Fit Adapter for Coloplast (Brava) tubes to fill a 5ml plastic syringe (Braun)

## What is is?
Helps transfering Coloplast and similar stomata care paste products from the original tube into smaller suringes (without needles). This helps in applying more defined / smaller amounts of the paste.

Multiple of these suringes (e.g. Braun Inject 5ml) can be filled with squeezing the paste from the tube. This can be done with holding the suringes close & tight to the tube fitting but, is not doable that easy.

This Adapter helps!

## Adaptions to other suringes / tubes
I can help in adjusting the design for other manufacturers, get in contact with me - or file a issue via github.

## Material
The Prototypes are 3D-Printed from PLA, and are designed in a way that the paste should actually have no contact with the printed part during the filling process. I will do some long term checks whether the printed parts can hold up with the task. Please don't use printed parts together with pastes that contain alcohol. Don't clean it with errosive substances or water hotter than you can stand it.
